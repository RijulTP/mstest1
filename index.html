            <h2>WORK EXPERIENCE</h2>

            <h3>FULL STACK DEVELOPER</h3>
            <li><b>Performance Tracking Library</b></li>
            Created a performance tracking library for API calls
            As a developer, I have designed and developed a performance tracking library to monitor and analyze the performance of API calls. The library provides valuable insights into how the system is performing, and it allows for the identification of any bottlenecks or areas of improvement.
The library collects various metrics such as response times,time differences making it easy to identify any issues as they arise.
To build the library, I used modern technologies such as Node.js, React Native. 
Overall, the performance tracking library has been a valuable addition to the company's development process. It has helped us to identify and resolve performance issues quickly, resulting in faster and more reliable software releases.
            <li><b>Survey Feature in React Native</b></li>

            As a React Native developer, I implemented a fully working survey feature for a mobile application. The feature enables users to participate in surveys and provide feedback on various aspects of the application.

To develop the feature, I leveraged the power of React Native to create a smooth and seamless user experience. I used various libraries and frameworks, including Redux and React Navigation, to handle state management and navigation between screens.

The survey feature consists of multiple screens, each displaying a different question or set of questions. Users can select their answers from a range of options, including radio buttons, checkboxes, and dropdown menus. The survey also includes open-ended questions that allow users to provide additional comments or feedback.

To ensure the accuracy and reliability of the survey results, I implemented various validation rules and error handling mechanisms. The feature also includes progress indicators that show users how far they have progressed through the survey and how many questions they have left to answer.

Finally, I integrated the survey feature with the backend API, which stores the survey responses and enables the application's administrators to analyze and review the results. I ensured that the feature was secure and scalable, capable of handling a large number of users and responses.

            <li><b>Imageeditor Web App</b></li>
            As a Full-Stack Web Developer, I was responsible for developing an image editor web application using PHP Laravel, Vite.js, and Python Selenium. The application enables users to upload images, edit them, and download the edited images.

To build the application, I used the Laravel PHP framework to create the backend server. I implemented RESTful APIs to handle user requests, such as uploading and downloading images, and editing images. The APIs were designed to be secure and efficient, with proper authentication and authorization mechanisms in place.

For the frontend, I used Vite.js, a modern build tool for web applications. I developed a responsive and user-friendly UI that enables users to upload images and edit them using various tools such as crop, resize, rotate, and filter. The frontend communicates with the backend through APIs, allowing for real-time updates and data synchronization.

            <h3>GAME DEVELOPER</h3>
            <li><b>Raytracer Engine</b></li>
            As a computer graphics enthusiast, I created a Raytracing engine from scratch based on Peter Shirley's book, "Ray Tracing in One Weekend." The engine is capable of rendering high definition images with realistic lighting and shadows.

To develop the engine, I first studied the principles of Raytracing and the underlying mathematics behind it. I then implemented the algorithm from scratch using C++ programming language. The engine can generate 3D scenes with multiple objects, light sources, and camera perspectives.

The engine uses Raytracing to simulate the path of light as it interacts with objects in the scene. It calculates the color of each pixel by tracing the path of light from the camera through the scene and calculating the color of the object that the ray intersects. The engine also implements various optimization techniques, such as BVH (Bounding Volume Hierarchy) and multithreading, to improve the rendering speed.

I used Peter Shirley's book as a guide to develop the Raytracing engine, implementing various techniques such as anti-aliasing, motion blur, and depth of field. I also added some of my own features, such as texture mapping and material properties.

The Raytracing engine that I created from scratch has been a valuable learning experience for me as a computer graphics developer. It has helped me to understand the principles of Raytracing and the underlying mathematics behind it.
            <li><b>Lua game</b></li>
            As a Lua programmer, I developed a fully working game based on ant survival. The game is a simulation of an ant colony where the player has to manage and maintain the colony's population while dealing with various challenges such as predators, food scarcity, and environmental factors.

            To develop the game, I used the Lua programming language, which is commonly used in game development due to its speed, simplicity, and flexibility.
            
            The game consists of several interconnected systems, including ant behavior, resource management, and environmental simulation. The resource management system includes food and water resources, which the player must manage carefully to ensure the survival of the colony.
            
            The game also features a dynamic environmental simulation, which includes weather patterns, day and night cycles, and seasonal changes. These factors affect the behavior of the ants and the availability of resources, making the game more challenging and realistic.
            
            To ensure the game's functionality and reliability, I implemented a testing and debugging process throughout the development cycle. I used various testing techniques, including unit testing and integration testing, to identify and fix bugs and errors.
